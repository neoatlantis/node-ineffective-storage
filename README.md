Ineffective Storage for Node.JS
===============================

The idea of this project is building a single javascript, which provides a
key-value based permanant storage feature to the application. New entries will
be appended to the storage file, and omitting the previously defined entries.
(It is possible to automatically optimize such files by elimating the too old
entries.) 

The storage is not designed to be effective, but to ease the task of developing
some module for storing simple configuration values, etc. It is also
configurable, leaving room for encryption or alike.
